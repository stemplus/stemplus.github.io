<h2>What is Ohm's Law?</h2>
<p>
    Ohm's law states that :
    <em>"the Current through the conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends provided the temperature remains constant."Consider a conductor across which voltage is applied</em>

Consider a conductor across which voltage is applied

    <p>Current starts flowing through a conductor, We can also express Current in terms of Voltage and Resistance as<br /><strong>V = IR</strong><br />where, V= Voltage applied to the conductor,<br /> R = Resistance of the conductor,<br /> I = Current flowing through the metal conductor. <br /><br />The Electric Current flows from high potential to the low potential point. This is due to the fact that the resistance offered by the point at low potential point is less and hence current gets easy path to flow.</p>

<h2 class="blocktitle">Ohm's Law Power</h2>

<p>Ohms law states the relationship between three basic quantities of the electric circuit namely <strong>Voltage</strong>, <strong>Current</strong> and <strong>Resistance</strong>. <br /><br />Ohms law can be stated as:<br /><span class="content_highlight">V = IR</span>where V = Voltage,<br /> I = Current,<br /> R = Resistance.<br /><strong><br /></strong></p>
    
<strong>Ohms Law Watts :</strong><br />The Units of Power is joule per second (J/s) or watts. The Watts gives the relationship between of these quantities with the power applied to the electrical appliance connected in the electrical circuit. The ohm's law and watts law can be combined together to form a pie chart using which we can find any of the four quantities namely <br />
